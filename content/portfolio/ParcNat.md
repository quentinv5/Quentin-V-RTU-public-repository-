[The Port-Cros National Parc](http://en.portcros-parcnational.fr/) includes the differents island off the coast of Hy√®res and the Giens Pininsula. Its missions is the protection of the natural wildlife in this area of the Mediterranean Sea. 
I had for mission to watch after the tourists visiting this place. For example not to throw the carbage but essentially for fire prevention.
