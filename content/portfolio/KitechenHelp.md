During two seasons I worked as a Kitchen assistant in the restaurant "Le Gratou". This restaurant is located in the city of Hy√®res-Les-Palmiers, in the south of France. This city is an important seaside resort during summer. Its success is due to its three beautiful island and long beaches on the Giens Peninsula.
