IPSA is an engineer school since 1961. The school has two campus located In Ivry-sur-Seine (Paris) and Toulouse. 

I started studying in IPSA in 2018 after Highschool. The first two years preparatory classes, which a lot of theoretical maths and physics.

The third year we can choose a option : vehicule or system. Vehicule is focus on the physocs of the aircraft, the fluids mechanics, thermodynamics etc.
For my part I chose System, I thought that was the domain were there will be more opportunities in the future. This option includes electronic, programming in several language, the embedded system and telecommunications.

The fourth year iq the continuation, we have to specialize ourseleves again and I chose the option : Embedded System and Telecommunications.
During the fourth year all the students must go on an exchange program, I went to latvia.
