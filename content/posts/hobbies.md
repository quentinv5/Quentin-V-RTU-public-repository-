## Sports

I used to practice judo for ten years, I had to stop when I started my studies. In compensation I was playing with my school rugby team.
While I was in Latvia, I looked for a new judo club and started again. Now that I'm going on the Paris campus I will continue judo for sure.

## Travel

I had the chance to leave in a new country for five months (Latvia), I travelled the most as I could.
I went to Lituania, Estonia and Poland with my friends. each we saw the capital (Vilnius, Tallin, Warsaw). Those cities are all very beautiful, I could recommand to travel through the baltic countries, they are very interesting.
